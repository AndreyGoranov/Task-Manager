# Frontend assignment
Welcome to the assignment for candidates applying for a frontend position at Falcon.io.

To get started clone this repo to your local computer and run the following commands.
```
npm install
npm start
```

Once everything is bootstraped navigate to `http://localhost:8080/doc.html` in your browser.<br/>
Here you should be met with a documentation page explaining the assignment in details and how to get started.<br/>
All information needed to get started is highlighted in the documentation. Please read it thoroughly.

Should you still have questions you're of course welcome to contact us.

**IMPORTANT**: This is a read-only repo and you'll not be able to `git push` to it. <br/>
To submit your test you must create your own repo, copy/fork the code-base of _this repo_ into _yours_ and provide us access.
Remember to copy over any dot files, i.e `.gitignore` etc.<br/>
Read more about how to submit in the documentation.

Enjoy!

Kind regards,<br/>
The frontend team @ Falcon.io
